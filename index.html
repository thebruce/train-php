				<h2>Big Reveal: Drupal aint nothing but PHP</h2>
				<h3>Drupal began as a CMS</h3>
				<p>So what does that mean for you?</p>
				<ul>
				  <li class="fragment">You can get started with the php you know.
				  <li class="fragment">You can stand on the shoulders of giants.
				  <li class="fragment">Small bits of code can do wonders.
				  <li class="fragment">Feel mostly confident that your code will be secure and protected.
				  <li class="fragment">It is not that hard&trade;

			    <h3>Your pet snail - a snail mail tale</h2>
			      <ol>
			        <li class="fragment">You want an awesome snail so you fill out a mail order form for a snail, write a check and put it in an envelope, and give it to the post man.</li>
			        <li class="fragment">The Postman gives the envelope to the mail sorter</li>
			        <li class="fragment">The mail sorter figures out which mail cart to put your envelope based on the address you indicated.</li>
			        <li class="fragment">So on and so forth - it is put on a truck, then a plane, then sorted for delivery, eventually winding up at the Snail Store where your order is fulfilled a snail is placed in a safe transportable home (a shell for his shell) and the process happens in reverse until... You get a snail by snail mail, thus ending the tale.</li>

			    <h3>Further Imagining: What if?</h3>
			    <ul>
			      <li class="fragment">What if all of the various people performing these actions announced what they were doing and asked for changes?</li>
			      <li class="fragment">What if some of the people:
			        <ol>
			          <li class="fragment"> Before they did anything said: "I am about to do this, any changes or actions you want to take?"</li>
			          <li class="fragment"> While they were doing something "I am doing this, any changes or things you need to do"</li>
			          <li class="fragment"> After they finished "Hey, i am done, anything you want to do now."</li>

			    <h3>Further Imagining: What if?</h3>
			    <ul>
			      <li>Finally - what if after your order was completed but before you got it:
			        <ol>
			          <li class="fragment">the snail's shell could be painted
			          <li class="fragment"> a different mollusk could be switched out with your snail
			          <li class="fragment"> somebody might call you and ask if you have permission to have this snail.

          <li class="fragment">Each step of the way various pieces of php code listen to hear what events are taking place and may or may not take actions in response
          <li class="fragment">Those events could be checking to see if you have access, deciding what content goes on the page, building the menu for the page you are on
